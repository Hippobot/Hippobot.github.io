## Projects
### Pytorch Job Applications Bot (NLP and Deep Learning)

Using NLP and web scrapping, created an application with the ability to apply to Linkedin easy apply positions. This utilized the pytorch for deep learning inorder to construct the application. The application is easily customizable by simply editing a json for a better user experience.

### Policing with Predictive Modeling

In Mecklenburg county we have the CMPD (Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department). In 2022, they gave out a complex data set spanning multiple years which detailed all sorts of crimes, locations, and many other criteria. The dataset was non anonymized while also having close to 1 million rows and 100s of features (columns). The dataset was also not clean in the slightest without any rubric/legend to reference for the column labels. I was tasked to see if I can bring any insights to the table from this dataset and then present to the relevant stakeholders. So I led a team of 4 of my peers to publish a report on the CMPD data and construct an XG-Boost classification model to predict vehicle crime from car characteristics (model, make, color, etc). We used ArcGIS to spatially join the shape files to the csv police dataset and create distance buffer zones.  We used Excel to clean and organize the data, then used python to initialize everything. This resulted in a model with a 70% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning. We then made changes to improve the model by another 9%. We found that red cars in certain census tracts were more likely to be stolen. We also found certain makes and models of vehicles are more likely to be stolen depending on the socio-economic status of the census tract. With that information, the CMPD could then make more concentrated efforts at certain census tracts.
